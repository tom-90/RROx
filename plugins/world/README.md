The **RROx World Loader plugin** loads all world data from game memory. This data can then be used by other plugins like the **RROx map plugin** to show to the user.

# Settings

The plugin provides a number of settings that allow you to customize how RROx interacts with the game world.

## Refresh intervals

It is possible to customize the intervals at which the world is loaded. A faster refresh time means the data will update faster, but this will be less performant.

It is possible to set a custom refresh interval for the spline data, as this is a big factor for the performance of the world loader.

## Features

The world loader provides a number of features that can be turned on or off depending on your preference:

- **Control Engines**: Enable/disable the ability to remotely control the engines.
- **Control Switches**: Enable/disable the ability to remotely control switches.
- **Teleport**: Enable/disable the ability for a player teleport anywhere on the map.
- **Cheats**: Enable/disable the ability for a player to change their money and use fast sprint and flying modes.
- **Control Cranes**: Enable/disable the ability to remotely cranes.
- **Rolling Stock Location Reset**: Added functionality for Rolling Stock Location Reset, which allows Game/Session Host (will not work for RROx Clients) to reset rolling stock location if required (may need re-railing after reset).
	--> Note: Momement is kept during/after location reset due to Game Logic/Implementation. May also have unexpected issues on larger saves with many phyiscs calculations (try only doing one car at a time on a fresh load in this case). Please allow framecar/rolling stock to come to a rest/stop before repeating/resetting another item (including the same item).
